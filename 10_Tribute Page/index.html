                    Karamchand Gandhi</a> (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was the leader of the Indian independence
                movement against British rule. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence
                and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā applied to
                him first in 1914 in South Africa is now used worldwide. In India, he is also called Bapu (Gujarati:
                endearment for "father") and Gandhiji. He is unofficially called the Father of the Nation.</p>

            <h2 id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Mahatma Gandhi's life:</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>October 2, 1869:</strong> Birth of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</li>
                <li><strong>September 4, 1888:</strong> Gandhi leaves for England to study law.</li>
                <li><strong>October 1899:</strong> Outbreak of Boer War (1899-1901) in South Africa. Gandhi organizes an
                    ambulance corps
                    for the British.</li>
                <li><strong>July 31, 1907:</strong> The Boer Republic Transvaal, now under the control of the British,
                    attempts to
                    register all Indians as members; Gandhi and others refuse to register. Their resistance efforts mark
                    the first use of nonviolent non-cooperation by the Indian minority in South Africa, soon
                    calledsatyagraha, or "soul-force."</li>
                <li><strong>January 11, 1908:</strong> Gandhi is arrested and sentenced to two months in prison.</li>
                <li><strong>August 15, 1947:</strong> Indian independence becomes official, as does the partition into
                    two countries,
                    India and Pakistan.</li>
                <li><strong>August-December 1948:</strong> India dissolves into chaos and killings, as Hindus and
                    Muslims flee for the
                    borders of India and Pakistan.</li>
                <li><strong>January 30, 1948:</strong> Gandhi is assassinated by Nathuram Vinayuk Godse, a Hindu
                    nationalist.</li>
            </ul>
